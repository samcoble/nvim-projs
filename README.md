# nvim-projs
 .lua based project manager.

Had trouble installing any mods so I just made one instead.
At least it's one file.
RIP shaDa: vim.opt.shada = ""

All menus are given a unique buffer and managed fairly well. Bindings are also managed. So far down to 620 lines w/ white space. LUA is way easier to deal with than python holy moly.
